# Serverless Tools Project

## Overview
A suite of lightweight, serverless, client-side tools hosted as static HTML websites. These tools are focused on usability, privacy, and independence.

### Key Features
- **No Login Required**: Access tools without creating accounts.
- **No Tracking**: Only a simple visitor count.
- **Ease of Use**: User-friendly interface.
- **Serverless**: All processing happens locally in the browser.
